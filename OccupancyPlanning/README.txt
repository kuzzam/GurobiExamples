In this problem, a mall owner wants to rent out space for stores. There are five types of stores: Jewlery, tailorshop, bank, bookstore and  clothing store.
The mall can house up to 3 stores per type. With the exception of Bookstore, at least one store from each other category has to exist in the mall.

Each store type has a specific area needed to function. The mall has a total area of 10000sm to lease.

Each store type has a specific approximation of sales that depends on how many other storres of its type exist in the mall.(utility matrix)

The goal of our optimization is to maximize the owner's profit with the given information.
