In this problem, we have a tournament where 8 teams compete in two rounds (winter and summer rounds).
Each round lasts 7 days and all the teams have to play each day.

Each team plays against each other team twice in total ( once a home game and once an away game as well as once per round)
Each team A that plays against team B on a specific day (.e.g third day) of the winter round has to play against team B on that specific day (respectively third day) of the summer round.


The goal of our optimization is to come up with a schedule where the number of successive home/away games per team is minimal. (e.g. Team A plays two home games on the first and second day of the winter round)
